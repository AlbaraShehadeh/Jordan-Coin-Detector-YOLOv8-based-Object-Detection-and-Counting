# Jordan Coins Detection (Tracking & Counting)

## Overview
Jordanian Coins Vision is a computer vision project focused on detecting and recognizing Jordanian coins using YOLOv8, powered by the Roboflow platform. The project aims to achieve accurate real-time object detection and counting of various denominations of Jordanian coins.




## Dataset:
The dataset for this project was created by capturing photos of Jordanian coins and then uploading them to the Roboflow platform.


### Data Collection:

The dataset consists of images with the following 9 classes:

- 5-Piastres
- 10-Piastres
- 1-4-dinar
- 1-2-dinar
- 1-dinar
- 5-dinars
- 10-dinar
- 20-dinar
- 50-dinar

  <img src="examples/example_4.jpg" alt="Example Annotated Image 4" width="300"/>
</div>




### Data Annotation:
Roboflow was used for annotation, making the dataset ready for training the YOLOv8 model.

Example Annotated Images:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="examples/annotated/1.png" alt="Example Annotated Image 1" width="300"/>
  <img src="examples/annotated/2.png" alt="Example Annotated Image 2" width="300"/>
</div>
